  This README discusses the usage of Bluetooth script file (BTS), a binary 
  file format that contains actions and commands for Texas Instruments
  Bluetooth devices. In addition to describing the file format specifications, 
  this README also explains about its naming convention and specifies which 
  bts file to use for each of Texas Instruments Bluetooth devices.

WHAT IS A BTS FILE?

  BTS is an abbreviation for Bluetooth script. The BTS file is a binary file 
  that contains commands and actions for Texas Instruments' Bluetooth devices.
  HCI communication is a two-way street. For each HCI command sent from the 
  host to a BT device, the BT device responds with an HCI event. In order to
  simplify the format and procedures required to successfully execute these 
  HCI commands, the BTS format is used. The BTS file consists of mandatory
  initialization scripts and additional platform-dependent, optional
  commands that are primarily used in the Bluetooth device initialization.
  The BTS file can be run either as a .bts file placed in the file system, 
  or be converted into a memory array in C language that can then be integrated
  into the code of the entire system. 

  BTS files are distributed under TEXAS INSTRUMENTS LICENSE - see the
  accompanying LICENSE file for more details. 

BTS FUNCTIONALITY

  The primary usage of the BTS format is to run the initialization script
  after the Bluetooth device powers up. The initialization script must be
  executed after every device power-up. BTS initialization scripts contain
  a section of memory write commands (written code to RAM) that perform as
  a software patch to fix potential ROM issues of the BT device.
  Although this is the primary purpose of the BTS format, it can also be 
  used in any scenario to load HCI commands to the Bluetooth device. BTS files
  may also be used for platform-related commands such as to enable deep-sleep
  mechanism, changing UART baud rate, audio configurations, etc.

BTS NAMING FORMAT

  Each initialization script corresponds to a single TI BT chip and firmware
  ROM version. These versions are indicated in the name of the initialization 
  script. The naming conventions of the TI BT chips are TIInit_X.Y.Z.bts,
  where:
  
  X = Product Name
  Y = ROM SW Major Number
  Z = ROM SW Minor Number
  
  6.6.15	= 	CC256xA Product, 6.15 ROM Version
  6.7.16 	= 	CC256xB Product, 7.16 ROM Version
  7.6.15 	= 	WL127x Product, 6.15 ROM Version
  10.6.15 	= 	WL128x, 6.15 ROM Version
  11.8.32 	= 	WL180x, WL183x, WL185x PG2.1 or PG2.2, 8.32 ROM Version
  12.8.32 	= 	WL187x PG2.1 or PG2.2, 8.32 ROM Version
  12.10.28 	= 	WL18xxQ PG1.11, 10.28 ROM Version
  
  Exception is the initialization files of CC256xA/B devices which are 
  provided as three separate bts files: 
  
  TIInit_6.7.16_bt_spec_4.x.bts - BT main bts file 
  TIInit_6.7.16_ble_add-on.bts - BLE functionality add-on
  TIInit_6.7.16_avpr_add-on.bts - AVPR (WBS, Assisted A2DP) functionality add-On
